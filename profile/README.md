# Welcome to VauL7 Zer0

Welcome to **VauL7 Zer0**, where we focus on the development of advanced technology and foster collaboration to push the boundaries of software development. Here, we work together to create innovative tools and solutions that drive progress in technology.

## About Kiwi

**Kiwi** is a lightweight scanner currently under development. It is designed to be public for anyone interested, providing an efficient and safe way to scan for specific information without engaging in hacking or data collection. Kiwi is intended to assist users in enhancing productivity and understanding their environments better, without compromising privacy or security.

This repository hosts the core code of Kiwi and features a couple of early screenshots to give a preview of what Kiwi can do. As we progress, we will add new features and updates, refining Kiwi into a more capable and user-friendly tool.

## Current Features

- **Program Core:** The essential building blocks of Kiwi have been laid out in the program code in this repository.
